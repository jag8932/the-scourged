  <h2>Description</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>The goal of the game is to survive until you reach the boss level. While the game
      is simple, it is pretty hard due to the high level of damage zombies can inflict.
      You get one weapon, a pistol, but you can deploy barricade defenses or turret guns 
      which will target the zombies. You cannot target the boss using the turret gun but a 
      good strategy is to have the boss run into the gunfire coming from it. The movement is 
      sort of funky as you can only move one direction at a time. This adds to the challenge of 
      dodging zombies or fireballs. Use the (WASD) keys to move and the mouse to shoot. 
      You can't run out of ammo but the turrets can. Upon running out of ammo, the turret 
      is destroyed. 
  </p>
  <p>For this project, I originally wanted to make an alien themed tower defense 
      type of game. I realised though that there weren't many top-down free sprites 
      available for what I wanted to make. I instead switched to zombies/monsters. 
      I also added a boss fight where the creature shoots purple beams of energy at 
      you. I tried to get the explosion spritesheet to work but unfortunately the animations
      didn't play. I found a nice font that I think matches the theme of the game. It looks modern
      but not out of place for a zombie/monster shooter. 
  </p>
  <p>Some challenges I faced along the way included understanding how PIXI js worked among other
     things. The container classes and app class confused me at first, but once I figured out how
     they worked, I implemented in multiple areas of my game. Another difficulty was being able 
     to find bugs. My main.js is over 600 lines long! This of course made reading through the code 
     difficult and in the future I will definitely organize my code better. One of the actual challenges
     that I faced with the programming logic was getting the sprites to rotate the way I wanted them to.
     I had to look up the math behind it and found this bunny shooter example. Once I understood that code
     I was able to add targets for some of my sprites and make the player rotate to the mouse. The site is 
     linked below. Finally, the biggest challenge of all was time management. I had to complete other projects
     and finals while also working on this. But if you are reading this, that means I have a website that works!
